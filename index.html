            <h3>User Interface Design Restaurant Menu</h3>
                <p>This project involved designing a modern, intuitive, and visually appealing user interface (UI) for a restaurant’s digital menu. The goal was to create a seamless, user-friendly experience for customers to browse the restaurant’s offerings, view detailed descriptions, and make selections easily. The design aimed to enhance the dining experience by providing clear navigation, visually attractive food categories, and easy interaction for users on different devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).</p>

            <h3>Library Management Using Database and Java Application</h3>
                <p>The Library Management System (LMS) is a software application designed to manage and automate various functions in a library, such as book cataloging, issue and return management, and user registration. The system provides an interface for librarians to track books, members, and transactions efficiently. Built with Java for the application and integrated with a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), this solution aims to streamline library operations, minimize manual errors, and enhance user experience. </p>

            <h3>IOT Project Fire Alarm Detection</h3>
                <P>This project is an IoT-powered fire detection system that monitors environments for signs of fire, such as smoke, temperature rise, or other critical parameters. When a potential fire hazard is detected, the system triggers an alarm and sends an instant notification to users via a mobile app or web dashboard. The goal was to create a real-time, automated fire alarm system with remote monitoring capabilities for increased safety.</P>
